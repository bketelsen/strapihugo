Earlier this week, [the Deis Labs team announced Krustlet](https://deislabs.io/posts/introducing-krustlet/), a Kubernetes kubelet implementation written in Rust that executes Web Assembly.

I pitched in on this release, especially on the [waSCC](https://wascc.dev/) provider.   I thought it would be fun to live-stream the creation of a waSCC actor and show it running in Kubernetes.

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy91W7OxHcQ) on Youtube.

Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/pull/174) adding the demo.
